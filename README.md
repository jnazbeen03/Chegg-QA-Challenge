# Chegg-QA-Challenge
JDK: 1.8
Language: Java, Selenium Webdriver, TestNG, Cucumber Feature. Build Tool: Maven
Selected Maven project to get pom.xml file where I can put all the dependencies and compiler based on the requirement. 
Then I have created four packages and then created classes based on the features. 
In the feature folder, I've created .feature files based on the features to write test cases.
Run the test cases from the cucumber feature.
From the snipped, I got my step definition and created stepdef class.
Created Base class to write common coding for the reusable purpose.
 Connected stepdef class to the Base class.
 I created Page Object Model and Test Runner class.
 In the Test Runner class, used "feature" keyword to connect feature folder.
 And used "glue" keyword to connect stepdef package.
 And "tags" keyword to run specific feature.
